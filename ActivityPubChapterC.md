This specification comes from years of hard work and experience by a number of communities exploring the space of federation on the web. In particular, much of this specification is informed by [OStatus](https://www.w3.org/community/ostatus/wiki/Main_Page) and the [Pump API](https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/blob/master/API.md), as pioneered by StatusNet (now GNU Social) and Pump.io. Both of those initiatives were the product of many developers' hard work, but more than anyone, Evan Prodromou has been a constant leader in this space, and it is unlikely that ActivityPub would exist in something resembling its current state without his hard work.

Erin Shepherd built the initial version of this specification, borrowed from the ideas in the [Pump API](https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/blob/master/API.md) document, mostly as a complete rewrite of text, but sharing most of the primary ideas while switching from ActivityStreams 1 to ActivityStreams 2.

Jessica Tallon and Christopher Lemmer Webber took over as editors when the standard moved to the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Social Working Group and did the majority of transition from Erin Shepherd's document to its current state as ActivityPub. Much of the document was rewritten and reorganized under the long feedback process of the Social Working Group.

ActivityPub has been shaped by the careful input of many members in the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Social Working Group. ActivityPub especially owes a great debt to Amy Guy, who has done more than anyone to map the ideas across the different Social Working Group documents through her work on [[Social-Web-Protocols](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#bib-Social-Web-Protocols)]. Amy also laid out the foundations for a significant refactoring of the ActivityPub spec while sprinting for four days with Christopher Allan Webber. These revisions lead to cleaner separation between the client to server and server components, along with clarity about ActivityPub's relationship to [[LDN](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#bib-LDN)], among many other improvements. Special thanks also goes to Benjamin Goering for putting together the implementation report template. We also thank mray for producing the spectacular tutorial illustrations (which are licensed under the same license as the rest of this document).

Many people also helped ActivityPub along through careful review.

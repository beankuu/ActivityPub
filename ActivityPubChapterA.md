### A. Internationalization

*This section is non-normative.*

Building an international base of users is important in a federated network. [ActivityStreams provides tooling for internationalization of content](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#naturalLanguageValues), which should be used whenever possible. However, it can be difficult for implementations to determine which [`@language` property](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#defaultlangcontext) to provide for user-submitted content. The [W3C Internationalization group](https://www.w3.org/International/) provides some [guidance on language detection](https://www.w3.org/International/wiki/LanguageDetection).
